Before jumping into Machine Learning or Deep Learning, consider Image Processing!

Sometimes, the solution to your problem doesnâ€™t require complex AI models â€” traditional image processing might be more than enough.

With techniques like:
ðŸ”¹ Morphological operations
ðŸ”¹ Thresholding
ðŸ”¹ Edge detection
ðŸ”¹ Filtering and segmentation

you can achieve powerful results without the need for large datasets or heavy computation.

I recently completed two mini-projects that show the strength of this approach in real-world applications:

âœ… Medical field â€“ Estimated baby age using ultrasound images.
âœ… Industrial field â€“ Detected rust in metal scrap images to aid in material assessment.

So before reaching for machine learning, explore the full potential of image processing. It might just be all you need!
